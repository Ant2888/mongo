The tests assume the following in your ansible inventory:
    - configdb: puts ALL configs in configdb[0]
    - mongos
    - loadgen
    - shardnofail
    - shardfail

The recommended setup (aka - I have no idea if this would work otherwise) are Ubuntu 16.04 LTS machines, following the topology specified in the Doc.
